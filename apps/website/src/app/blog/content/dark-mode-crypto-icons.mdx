Dark mode isn't optional anymore. Most users expect it, many prefer it, and if you're building a crypto application, your users probably spend hours staring at your UI watching charts and managing positions. A properly implemented dark mode reduces eye strain and looks more professional.

But there's a problem that every crypto app developer hits: **branded token icons look terrible on dark backgrounds.**

This guide explains why, shows the standard solutions, and walks through implementation patterns for switching icon variants based on your theme.

## The problem with branded icons on dark backgrounds

Open any crypto app and look at the token icons. On a white background, they look great. Bitcoin's orange circle pops, USDC's blue stands out, Chainlink's blue hexagon is crisp and readable.

Now put those same icons on a `#0a0a0a` background. Several problems appear immediately:

**Black outlines disappear.** Many token logos use black outlines or elements. On a dark background, these vanish. The icon loses its shape and becomes unrecognizable.

**Low-contrast colors become muddy.** Dark blues, purples, and greens that looked vibrant on white now blend into the dark background. Tokens like Polygon and Fantom become hard to distinguish.

**White elements create harsh spots.** Some tokens use white fills (Solana, for example). On a dark background, these white areas create jarring bright spots that draw the eye for the wrong reasons.

**Transparent backgrounds expose the problem.** Most SVG icons have transparent backgrounds. This is fine on white, but on dark backgrounds every contrast issue is amplified.

The result is an icon set that looks inconsistent, unprofessional, and sometimes literally unreadable.

## The wrong solutions

### Adding a white circle behind every icon

The most common quick fix: wrap each icon in a white circle background.

```tsx
// ❌ Don't do this
function TokenWithBackground({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return <div className="rounded-full bg-white p-1">{children}</div>
}
```

This "works" but looks terrible. You've broken your dark mode aesthetic by introducing bright white circles everywhere. The icons look like they're stuck on stickers. It's a band-aid.

### Adjusting brightness/contrast with CSS filters

Some developers try CSS filters to make icons "work" in dark mode:

```css
/* ❌ Don't do this either */
.dark .token-icon {
  filter: brightness(1.2) contrast(1.1);
}
```

This creates inconsistent results. Some icons look okay, others look washed out, and you're fighting a losing battle with each new token you add. Filters can't add contrast where the original design doesn't have it.

### Maintaining two PNG sets

The enterprise approach: create separate light and dark versions of every icon manually.

This technically works, but the maintenance cost is brutal. Every time a token rebrands or a new one is added, you need to update two sets. With 100+ tokens in a typical app, this becomes a full-time job nobody wants.

## The right solution: Mono icon variants

Use **mono** (single-color) icon variants in dark mode. A mono icon strips away brand colors and renders the token's distinctive shape in a single color that you control.

This solves every problem:

- **Consistent contrast**: Every icon has the same visual weight regardless of the original brand colors.
- **Adapts to any background**: Set the icon color to match your text color and it works on any theme.
- **Preserves recognition**: Users recognize tokens by their shape (Bitcoin's B, Ethereum's diamond, Solana's gradient angle). Mono icons keep these shapes intact.
- **Zero maintenance**: The same icon works for any color scheme.

Here's what it looks like with web3icons:

<LiveExample
  tabs={[
    {
      label: 'branded',
      preview: <TokenBTC variant="branded" size={48} />,
      content: `import { TokenBTC } from '@web3icons/react'\n\n// Full brand colors for light mode\n<TokenBTC size={48} variant="branded" />`
    },
    {
      label: 'mono',
      preview: <TokenBTC variant="mono" size={48} />,
      content: `import { TokenBTC } from '@web3icons/react'\n\n// Clean, consistent mono for dark mode\n<TokenBTC size={48} variant="mono" />`
    },
  ]}
/>

```tsx
import { TokenBTC, TokenETH, TokenSOL } from '@web3icons/react'

// In light mode: full brand colors
<TokenBTC size={24} variant="branded" />
<TokenETH size={24} variant="branded" />
<TokenSOL size={24} variant="branded" />

// In dark mode: clean, consistent mono icons
<TokenBTC size={24} variant="mono" />
<TokenETH size={24} variant="mono" />
<TokenSOL size={24} variant="mono" />
```

## Implementation patterns

### Pattern 1: Theme-aware icon component

Create a wrapper component that automatically selects the right variant based on your theme:

```tsx
import { TokenIcon } from '@web3icons/react/dynamic'

// Works with any theme system: next-themes, CSS classes, context, etc.
function useIsDarkMode(): boolean {
  // Replace with your actual theme detection
  const [isDark, setIsDark] = useState(false)

  useEffect(() => {
    const match = window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)')
    setIsDark(match.matches)
    const handler = (e: MediaQueryListEvent) => setIsDark(e.matches)
    match.addEventListener('change', handler)
    return () => match.removeEventListener('change', handler)
  }, [])

  return isDark
}

function AdaptiveTokenIcon({
  symbol,
  size = 24,
}: {
  symbol: string
  size?: number
}) {
  const isDark = useIsDarkMode()

  return (
    <TokenIcon
      symbol={symbol}
      size={size}
      variant={isDark ? 'mono' : 'branded'}
    />
  )
}
```

### Pattern 2: Using next-themes

If you're using Next.js with `next-themes`, the integration is straightforward:

```tsx
'use client'
import { useTheme } from 'next-themes'
import { TokenIcon } from '@web3icons/react/dynamic'
import { TVariant } from '@web3icons/common'

function ThemeTokenIcon({
  symbol,
  size = 24,
  forcedVariant,
}: {
  symbol: string
  size?: number
  forcedVariant?: TVariant
}) {
  const { resolvedTheme } = useTheme()

  const variant: TVariant =
    forcedVariant ?? (resolvedTheme === 'dark' ? 'mono' : 'branded')

  return <TokenIcon symbol={symbol} size={size} variant={variant} />
}
```

The `forcedVariant` prop lets you override the automatic behavior when you specifically want a branded icon in dark mode (for a token detail page hero section, for example).

### Pattern 3: CSS-class-based theme detection

If your app uses CSS classes for theming (like Tailwind's `dark:` variant), you can handle this at the component level:

```tsx
import { TokenIcon } from '@web3icons/react/dynamic'

function DualTokenIcon({
  symbol,
  size = 24,
}: {
  symbol: string
  size?: number
}) {
  return (
    <>
      <span className="dark:hidden">
        <TokenIcon symbol={symbol} size={size} variant="branded" />
      </span>
      <span className="hidden dark:inline">
        <TokenIcon symbol={symbol} size={size} variant="mono" />
      </span>
    </>
  )
}
```

This renders both variants and uses CSS to show/hide them. It means two SVGs in the DOM, but SVGs are lightweight and this avoids hydration mismatches in server-rendered apps.

### Pattern 4: Mono with custom color

Mono icons inherit the current color by default, but you can set a specific color that complements your dark mode palette:

```tsx
// Subtle, muted icons that don't compete with your content
<TokenIcon symbol="ETH" size={24} variant="mono" color="#6b7280" />

// Slightly brighter for important elements
<TokenIcon symbol="ETH" size={24} variant="mono" color="#d1d5db" />

// Accent-colored icons for active states
<TokenIcon symbol="ETH" size={24} variant="mono" color="#3b82f6" />
```

This level of control is impossible with branded PNGs.

## When to use branded icons in dark mode

Mono icons aren't always the right choice. There are situations where brand colors add genuine value, even on dark backgrounds:

**Token detail pages**: When the user has navigated specifically to a token's page, they want to see the real brand icon. Use it as a hero element with appropriate spacing and contrast.

**Marketing and landing pages**: Brand colors create visual interest and help users quickly identify tokens they recognize.

**Comparison views**: When users are choosing between tokens, brand colors help differentiate at a glance. Consider the `background` variant here. The circular background provides consistent framing:

```tsx
<TokenIcon symbol="ETH" size={48} variant="background" />
```

The `background` variant places the icon inside a circular shape with the token's brand color as the background, which creates reliable contrast on any surface.

## Designing a consistent system

Here's a practical framework for when to use each variant in your app:

| Context                | Light mode | Dark mode              |
| ---------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------- |
| Navigation / sidebar   | mono       | mono                   |
| Token list rows        | branded    | mono or background     |
| Token detail hero      | branded    | branded (with spacing) |
| Data tables            | mono       | mono                   |
| Search results         | background | background             |
| Transaction history    | mono       | mono                   |
| Portfolio chart legend | branded    | mono                   |
| Notifications          | background | background             |

The general rule: **use mono anywhere information density is high and branded anywhere the icon is a focal point.**

## Testing your dark mode icons

A few things to verify:

- Check icons at all sizes you use (16px, 24px, 32px, 48px). Mono icons at small sizes should still be recognizable.
- Test with both system dark mode and your app's theme toggle.
- Verify that server-rendered HTML matches client-rendered state (no flash of wrong variant).
- Check the icons against your actual background colors, not just "dark" in the abstract.

## Wrapping up

Dark mode crypto icons don't have to be a pain. The pattern is simple:

1. Use `branded` icons for light mode and featured placements
2. Use `mono` icons for dark mode and information-dense contexts
3. Use `background` icons when icons need to stand alone on any surface
4. Build a wrapper component that selects the variant based on your theme

With [web3icons](https://web3icons.io), all three variants are available for every icon in the library. Install `@web3icons/react`, pick the pattern that fits your stack, and dark mode icons become a solved problem.
