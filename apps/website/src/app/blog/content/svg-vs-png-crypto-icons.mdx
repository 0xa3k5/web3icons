Most crypto apps use PNG icons for their token logos. It's the path of least resistance: download the logo from CoinGecko, drop it in your assets folder, render it with an `<img>` tag. Done.

But PNG is almost always the wrong choice for crypto icons. SVG outperforms it on every metric that matters: file size, visual quality, dark mode compatibility, accessibility, and developer experience.

This isn't an abstract format comparison. Let's look at real numbers and practical trade-offs that affect your app.

## File size comparison

We measured a sample of 50 popular token icons in both formats:

**PNG at 128x128 (standard resolution):**

- Average: 8.4 KB
- Median: 6.2 KB
- Range: 1.8 KB - 32 KB

**PNG at 256x256 (retina/2x):**

- Average: 18.7 KB
- Median: 14.1 KB
- Range: 3.2 KB - 68 KB

**SVG (optimized):**

- Average: 2.1 KB
- Median: 1.6 KB
- Range: 0.4 KB - 8 KB

The SVG versions are **4x smaller** than standard PNGs and **9x smaller** than retina PNGs. The SVG looks perfect at any resolution, so you don't need separate files for different pixel densities.

For a portfolio app showing 50 token icons:

- PNG (1x): ~420 KB of icon data
- PNG (2x): ~935 KB of icon data
- SVG: ~105 KB of icon data

That's an 800 KB difference in the retina case. On a slow mobile connection, that's noticeable.

## Scalability

PNGs are raster images. They're a fixed grid of pixels. Scale them up beyond their native resolution and they get blurry. Scale them down and you're wasting bandwidth sending pixels the screen doesn't need.

SVGs are vectors. They describe shapes mathematically. They render perfectly at 16 pixels, 160 pixels, or 1600 pixels. This matters more than you might think:

**Different contexts need different sizes.** A token icon might appear at:

- 16px in a dropdown menu
- 24px in a table row
- 32px in a card
- 48px in a detail page
- 64px+ in a hero section

With PNGs, you either ship multiple sizes (increasing complexity and total download) or accept blurriness at some sizes. With SVGs, one file works everywhere.

```tsx
import { TokenETH } from '@web3icons/react'

// The same component, sharp at every size
<TokenETH size={16} variant="branded" />
<TokenETH size={32} variant="branded" />
<TokenETH size={64} variant="branded" />
```

## Dark mode and styling

This is where SVGs have a decisive advantage. An SVG is markup, made of `<path>`, `<circle>`, and `<rect>` elements that can be styled with CSS and manipulated with JavaScript.

A mono SVG icon can change color dynamically:

```tsx
// White icon on dark background
<TokenETH size={24} variant="mono" color="#ffffff" />

// Gray icon for subtle contexts
<TokenETH size={24} variant="mono" color="#6b7280" />

// Accent-colored icon
<TokenETH size={24} variant="mono" color="#3b82f6" />
```

A PNG can't do this. It's a flat raster image. You can apply CSS `filter` hacks (brightness, invert, hue-rotate), but the results are unreliable and look bad on complex multi-color logos.

For dark mode specifically, the mono variant of web3icons SVGs gives you clean, consistent icons that adapt to any background. Read [Dark Mode and Crypto Icons](/blog/dark-mode-crypto-icons) for a deep dive on implementation patterns.

## Rendering performance

There's a common misconception that PNGs are "faster to render" than SVGs. Let's break this down:

**Decoding**: PNGs need to be decoded from their compressed format into a pixel buffer. Complex PNGs with many colors and transparency can be slow to decode. SVGs need to be parsed (XML) and rasterized, which takes CPU time. For simple icons, both are fast. For complex icons with many paths, SVGs can be marginally slower to first-render.

**Caching**: Once rendered, both formats are cached by the browser. Subsequent renders are effectively instant.

**Network**: SVGs win here. Smaller files transfer faster. Less data to cache. For a page with 50+ icons (typical in crypto apps), the reduced network transfer from SVGs matters more than any rendering difference.

**Inlining**: SVGs can be inlined directly into your HTML or JSX, eliminating HTTP requests entirely. The icon data arrives with the document. PNGs always require a separate request.

```tsx
// This SVG is part of your JS bundle, no separate network request
import { TokenBTC } from '@web3icons/react'

// This PNG is a separate HTTP request
;<img src="/icons/btc.png" alt="Bitcoin" width={24} height={24} />
```

With web3icons' React components, every icon is an inline SVG. Zero additional HTTP requests.

## Accessibility

SVGs are part of the DOM. Screen readers can access them. You can add `<title>` and `<desc>` elements inside SVGs for rich accessible descriptions. You can use `aria-label` and `role` attributes directly on SVG elements.

```tsx
<TokenBTC size={24} variant="branded" role="img" aria-label="Bitcoin" />
```

PNGs in `<img>` tags only get the `alt` attribute. That's usually enough, but SVGs give you more control when you need it.

## Animation potential

SVGs can be animated with CSS or JavaScript. Individual paths can transition, morph, or respond to user interaction. While animating token icons isn't a common pattern, there are practical use cases:

- **Loading states**: Animate a mono icon's opacity or stroke while data loads
- **Hover effects**: Scale or color-shift an icon on hover without layout shift
- **Transitions**: Smoothly morph between mono and branded variants

```css
.token-icon {
  transition: color 200ms ease;
}

.token-icon:hover {
  color: #ff3d00;
}
```

With a mono SVG, the icon smoothly transitions to your accent color. With a PNG, you can't do this.

## When PNGs still make sense

To be fair, there are cases where PNGs (or raster formats) are the better choice:

**Photographic or highly complex logos**: Some tokens have logos with complex gradients, textures, or photorealistic elements that don't translate well to SVG. These are rare in crypto (most logos are geometric), but they exist.

**External/untrusted sources**: If you're pulling icons from an API you don't control and can't guarantee the SVGs are safe, PNGs are the safer choice. SVGs can contain embedded scripts (though this is mitigated by React's rendering model and proper sanitization).

**Canvas rendering**: If you're drawing to an HTML canvas (for charts or graphs), PNGs are simpler to work with. Canvas doesn't natively render SVGs without conversion.

For the vast majority of crypto icon use cases, SVG is the right format.

## The web3icons approach

[Web3 Icons](https://web3icons.io) is built SVG-first. Every icon in the library is:

- **Optimized**: SVGs are cleaned and optimized with SVGO to remove unnecessary metadata, simplify paths, and minimize file size.
- **Consistent**: All icons follow the same viewBox, sizing, and structural conventions.
- **Triple-varianted**: Each icon has `branded`, `mono`, and `background` SVG variants for different contexts.
- **Tree-shakeable**: Import only what you use. Unused icons are stripped from your production bundle.

The React components render inline SVGs, giving you all the advantages above with a clean developer experience:

```tsx
import { TokenIcon, NetworkIcon } from '@web3icons/react/dynamic'

function AssetRow({ symbol, network }: { symbol: string; network: string }) {
  return (
    <div className="flex items-center gap-3">
      <TokenIcon symbol={symbol} size={24} variant="branded" />
      <NetworkIcon network={network} size={16} variant="mono" />
      <span>
        {symbol} on {network}
      </span>
    </div>
  )
}
```

No `<img>` tags, no separate HTTP requests, no blurry icons, no dark mode headaches.

## Migration checklist: PNG to SVG

If your app currently uses PNG icons and you want to migrate:

1. **Install web3icons**: `npm install @web3icons/react`
2. **Replace `<img>` tags** with icon components
3. **Choose variants**: map your current "light" and "dark" icon sets to `branded` and `mono`
4. **Remove old PNG files** from your assets directory
5. **Test at all sizes**: verify icons look sharp at every size you use
6. **Check bundle size**: you should see a reduction, especially if you were serving retina PNGs
7. **Verify accessibility**: add `aria-label` attributes where icons convey meaning
