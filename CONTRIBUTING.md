2. Create a new issue, providing a clear title and a detailed description of the bug or the problem with the icon.
3. If possible, include screenshots or additional documentation to help us understand the issue.
4. Submit the issue, and we will look into it promptly.

### Requesting New Icons

We're constantly looking to expand `token-icons` with new and updated icons. If there's a specific icon you'd like to see included:

1. Check the repository first to ensure the icon isn't already available.
2. If the icon is not present, open a [New Icon Request](https://github.com/0xa3k5/web3icons/issues/new?assignees=&labels=icon-request&template=icon-request.md&title=%5BICON+REQUEST%5D) issue on GitHub.
3. Provide the name of the token, a link to the official logo (if available), and any other relevant details.
4. We will review the request and work on adding the icon to the token-icons.
